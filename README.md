ECS: Electronic Connectivity System (ECS) for wireless connection of sensors and actuators with cloud 
======

ECS is a firmware for ESP32 Microcontroller for designing of device to cloud connectivity. It can be used for fast prototyping of connectivity solutions.
There is a test code for STM32 Microcontroller that simulates a device with sensors and actuators. The ESP32 interfaces with the simulated device over a binary SPI protocol.
